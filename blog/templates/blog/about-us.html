  <p id = "demo">I am a Mexican American who was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois.
    When I was in 8th grade I was first introduced to computer science from a STEM program
    I was apart of. The teacher we had introduced us to HTML and CSS by having us use Mozilla
    Thimble. Over the years I have become more passionate about Computer Science and plan on majoring in Cyber Security.</p>

    <p id = "demo">I was born in Nigeria and came to America as an immigrant at the age of 7
    and was raised in Chicago, Illinois ever since. My intesrest in computer science was excited when i joined
  my school's Girls Who Code Program and from there I learned about the summer immersion internship. Our final project
  was to solve a problem we felt strongly about and use a piece of code to construct the solution. I'm proud of our outcome
  and plan on minoring in computer science and majoring in pre-medicine. I'm thankful to have had this opportunity.  </p>

  <p id = "demo">I, also, am a proud Mexican American, born and raised in Chicago.
     I recently became interested in computer science thanks to Girls Who Code.
      If it weren't for my counselor who told me about the program, I would have never come
  come across this amazing opportunity. Thanks to GWC, I learned how to use HTML and
  Python, among others. Computer science has changed my life in many aspects and I
   definitely encourage others, especially women, to look into learning more about
computer science.</p>

  <p id = "demo">I am a Mexican American who was born in Zacatecas, Mexico but raised
    in Chicago, Illinois. In my freshman year of high school I was introduced to Computer
    Science but didn't actually have an interest. Two years later
  in my junior year my counselor informed me about Girls Who Code Summer Program. This
  was the first time I actually learned about HTML and CSS.</p>
